Automatic Cane Feeding Control

This is my final project for achieving Bachelor of Applied Engineering. This project focuses on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative control system to regulate the speed of a cane carrier motor in a sugar factory based on the sugarcane bagasse level in the chute. The goal is to minimize frequent sugarcane pile-ups caused by a mismatch between motor speed and material flow.

Component Description:

- Proximity Sensor: Monitors the bagasse level in the chute.
- Arduino Uno: Processes sensor data and runs the PID algorithm.
- VFD (ATV12HU15M2): Regulates motor speed based on the PWM signal from the Arduino.
- 3-Phase Induction Motor: Drives the cane carrier.
- Power Supply & Buck Converter: Provides power for the entire system.

üîÑ System Flowchart
The system workflow is defined by the following flowchart:

Flowchart Explanation:

- The system starts with component initialization.
- The proximity sensor reads the material level in the chute.
- Arduino compares the actual level with the setpoint.
- Based on the error, the PID algorithm calculates the PWM value.
- The PWM signal is sent to the VFD to adjust the motor speed.
- The process repeats in real-time.
