This is my final project for achieving Bachelor of Applied Engineering focuses on implementing a Proportional-Integral-Derivative control system to regulate the speed of a cane carrier motor in a sugar factory based on the sugarcane bagasse level in the chute. The goal is to minimize frequent sugarcane pile-ups caused by a mismatch between motor speed and material flow.
